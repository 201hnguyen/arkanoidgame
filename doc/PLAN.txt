PLAN

1. One variant of Breakout that I thought was interesting and what was interesting about it:
I really enjoyed the Devilish version of Breakout because of the scrolling nature of the game.
Because of the scrolling effect, it introduces a narrative component to the game that is not otherwise
present in other versions. I also enjoyed the characters, which further contribute to this narrative
effect. While it may not be feasible to implement such scrolling feature in my given time frame, the
idea of framing the game as some kind of narrative is definitely something that I can implement to
give a bit of an extra dimension to it. To play with this idea of creating a narrative, I'm planning on building
a Harry Potter themed version of Breakout, where Harry casts a spell that forms the paddle (see
"harrypotter.png" file for a visual). I am also planning on making a door at the top of the screen (above
all the blocks), of which the avatar will move toward at the end of the gameScene to advance to the next gameScene.

2. General description of different levels I intend to build:
I plan on having 3 levels. Each gameScene will have a 10x10 bricks layout. Below are the levels' brick configurations.
LEVEL 1:
1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2
0 2 2 2 0 0 1 1 1 0
0 0 3 0 3 3 0 3 0 0
0 2 2 2 0 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2
0 2 2 2 0 0 1 1 1 0
0 0 3 0 3 3 0 3 0 0
0 2 2 2 0 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2
0 2 2 2 0 0 1 1 1 0

LEVEL 2:
3 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 3
0 2 2 2 0 3 2 2 2 0
0 2 2 2 3 0 2 2 2 0
0 2 2 2 0 3 2 2 2 0
1 3 1 3 2 2 3 1 3 1
1 3 1 3 2 2 3 1 3 1
0 2 2 2 0 1 2 2 2 0
0 2 2 2 1 0 2 2 2 0
0 2 2 2 0 1 2 2 2 0
3 1 2 1 2 2 3 2 3 1

LEVEL 3:
3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3
3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3
3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3
3 2 3 3 2 3 3 2 3 3
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
2 1 1 2 1 1 2 1 1 2
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3
1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1

As shown above, the first gameScene has the least number of bricks (0's indicate no bricks in that space), and
the lowest ratio of gameScene 3 bricks; the second gameScene has more bricks than the first one (but the entire
structure is still not filled), and also has a higher ratio of gameScene 3 bricks; then, the most difficult
gameScene's structure is entirely filled up with bricks, and there are also more gameScene 3 bricks compared to
gameScene 1 and gameScene 2 bricks. I also plan to make the ball move 1.5-2x faster with each increment in difficulty.

3. Several different bricks I want to create:
Hits-wise, I will have 3 types of bricks: one color brick that takes 1 hit to break, one that takes 2 hits to
break, and one that takes 3 hits to break. However, I will actually implement 6 types of bricks. Consider brick
types #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, and #6. Type #1 and #4 will look and work exactly the same; except that under the
surface, a #4 brick is a #1 brick with a hidden lightning power (see power ups section). Likewise, #2 and #5
will look and work the same, but #5 will contain the hidden horn power (see power ups section). Then, #3 and #6
will look and work the same, but #6 will contain the hidden potion power (see power ups section). When
implementing, I will merely pick a few #1, #2, and #3 bricks from the gameScene configurations above and convert
them to #4, #5, and #6 bricks.

4. Several different power ups I want to create:
I want to create 3 power ups. These are as follows:
- The lightning power: There will be a cartoon lightning that flashes on the screen. Any brick that intersects/
that gets hit by the lightning will be eliminated.
- The horn power: Allows Harry to "call in a few friends." This will call in another character to cast the spell,
which essentially extends the paddle.
- The potion power: This gives Harry back one life.

5. Several different cheat keys I plan to include:
Apart from the 'L', 'R', and '1-9' keys required, I also want to implement the 'D' key that calls in
"Dumbledore's Army," i.e., a row of students whose spells form a paddle that extends the width of the screen
(so basically, there is no way for the ball to fall off the bottom of the screen). I also plan on implementing
the 'C' code that automatically clears all bricks in a single row. If I have time, I also want to see if I can
do a 'B' cheat code (more of a funny one). This one will simulate the effect of Harry losing his glasses,
so the entire screen will just turn blurry and you play the rest of the gameScene in blurry mode.

6. Something extra I intend to add and why I think this is a substantial addition:
I want to make certain sections of the walls "dead sections," meaning that, if the ball bounces off this very small,
particular region of any of the wall (except for the bottom one, because the entire bottom wall is already a dead
section), then some event happens and the player automatically loses a life. This introduces another element of challenge
in the game, and I think following the idea of the narrative, these "dead sections" can have some kind of context around
them (ex. an alarm that alerts Voldemort of Harry's location, etc.); this will add an interesting component to the narrative.
